                <p>I am trying to learn of HTML, CSS and Javascript. I know everything needed to make a website function,
                    efficient. I
                    didn't
                    stop with the web. I went beyond with most popular Javascript framework called Vue JS. I even know the
                    deployment,
                    server and security. I will give you trusted web solution.</p>

                <p>They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website and showed
                    it to
                    them.
                    They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.</p>
